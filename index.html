    <strong><a href="btc.html">BITCOIN</a></strong>
    <p>Bitcoin is a payment system introduced as open-source software in 2009 by developer Satoshi Nakamoto. The payments in the system are recorded in a public ledger using its own unit of account, which is also called bitcoin. Payments work peer-to-peer without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the US Treasury to call bitcoin a decentralized virtual currency. Although its status as a currency is disputed, media reports often refer to bitcoin as a cryptocurrency or digital currency.</p>
    <p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. Called mining, individuals or companies engage in this activity in exchange for transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides mining, bitcoins can be obtained in exchange for fiat money, products, and services. Users can send and receive bitcoins electronically for an optional transaction fee using wallet software on a personal computer, mobile device, or a web application.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has seen growth, and merchants have an incentive to accept the digital currency because fees are lower than the 2 to 3% typically imposed by credit card processors. The European Banking Authority has warned that bitcoin lacks consumer protections. Unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser not the vendor. Bitcoins can be stolen and chargebacks are impossible. Commercial use of bitcoin is currently small compared to its use by speculators, which has fueled price volatility.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny amid concerns that it can be used for illegal activities. In October 2013 the US FBI shut down the Silk Road online black market and seized 144,000 bitcoins worth US$28.5 million at the time. The US is considered bitcoin-friendly compared to other governments. In China, buying bitcoins with yuan is subject to restrictions, and bitcoin exchanges are not allowed to hold bank accounts.</p>
    <p>On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "block chain" which let users bypass Bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins. On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.</p>

    <strong><a href="#">DARKCOIN</a></strong>
    <p>Unlike Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based alt-coins which have transparent electronic transactions, Darkcoin can be equated with online cash due to its private/anonymous transactions that resemble the anonymity of private cash transactions.</p>

	<p>The low inflation characteristics allows Darkcoin to have increased store of wealth properties compared to other coins. The same characteristic also ensures that the coin's price is significantly more protected from the selling of daily mining production from those who are interested in acquiring bitcoins through altcoin mining.</p>

	<p>As of March 25 2014 the entire mining production of Darkcoin for a single day can be acquired for ~17 BTC, compared to ~806 BTC for Litecoin, ~410 BTC for Dogecoin and ~82 BTC for Vertcoin. In this way daily inflation cannot present serious problems for price stability and growth.</p>
	<p>X11 is proof of work algorithm that uses 11 different hashing functions to calculate the block header. The algorithm was developed by Evan Duffield, the creator of Darkcoin. X11 was intended to be ASIC resistant to keep mining CPU and GPU friendly. Critics cite that ASICs are possible though and will be much power powerful than scrypt ASICs.</p>
	<p>X11 suffers from the problems stemming from increased propagation latency and slow verification, and adds even worse susceptibility to ASIC advantage. It is a mere mishmash of 11 separate algorithms that are now GPU mineable (according to the Darkcoin homepage). Anything GPU mineable can be implemented in custom hardware. To make matters worse, ASICs could even have a major speedup advantage over GPUs. adam3mus said, it does seem likely that eg if the unused space due to heat can be filled with the other hashes, then it can all be pipelined together and no slowdown. the only cost is replicating different hash functions which doesnt seem particularly hard.</p>

    <strong><a href="#">LITECOIN</a></strong>
    <p>Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world. It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs from Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware. Litecoin provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average) and uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target the regular computers with GPUs most people already have. The Litecoin network is scheduled to produce 84 million currency units.</p>
    <p>One of the aims of Litecoin was to provide a mining algorithm that could run at the same time, on the same hardware used to mine Bitcoins. With the rise of specialized ASICs for Bitcoin, Litecoin continues to satisfy these goals. It is unlikely for ASIC mining to be developed for Litecoin until the currency becomes more widely used.</p>
    <p>One of the aims of Litecoin was to provide a mining algorithm that could run at the same time, on the same hardware used to mine Bitcoins. With the rise of specialized ASICs for Bitcoin, Litecoin continues to satisfy these goals. It is unlikely for ASIC mining to be developed for Litecoin until the currency becomes more widely used.</p>
    <p>The main feature is use of scrypt as its proof-of-work algorithm. A proof-of-work algorithm creates a computational challenge to be solved by the network of computers in order to "certify" a "block" of transactions. scrypt was developed in 2009 by Colin Percival of Tarsnap Inc., and--in contrast with Bitcoin’s SHA-256d--serves to inhibit hardware scalability by requiring a significant amount of memory when performing its calculations. This change reduces the efficiency gain and economic incentive to develop custom hardware such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). While ASICs can be adopted for any purpose and are likely to be introduced for Litecoin, the use of scrypt should delay this change, and preserve the decentralization in mining that brings a decentralized currency so much of its value and resiliency.</p>
    <p>The second important feature is a reduced transaction confirmation time targeted at 2.5 minutes on average. Bitcoin confirms transactions every 10 minutes on average and reasonable security measures mean waiting one to two hours is often recommended. Litecoin’s faster confirmations provide end-users with faster access to their finances, especially in time-sensitive situations.</p>

    <strong><a href="#">VERTCOIN</a></strong>
    <p>Vertcoin is a cryptographic currency, similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin, with one major difference. As the forerunner of the digital currency movement, the original Bitcoin developers were unable to perceive all potential threats that would arise to challenge it's mission as a decentralized currency.</p>
    <p>Millions of dollars were spent by various companies to build application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) computers in an attempt to monopolize mining. These devices made it so GPUs and CPUs were no longer useful in the mining process. As a result, the vast majority of Bitcoin mining and transactions would now be processed by large data centers that required hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars in investment.</p>
    <p>Now that Bitcoin computational power is handled almost entirely by large data centers, the currency has rapidly changed from a distributed, decentralized currency, to one that is much more centralized and vulnerable. Companies such as Cex.io are routinely hitting 40% PoW computational power on a daily basis, and will soon be able to perform 51% attacks at will, if they so choose.</p>
    <p>Due to the problems ASIC chips brought on the digital currency platform, a new currency, Litecoin was created.  Litecoin attempted to utilize the Scrypt hashing algorithm, which is more memory intensive than SHA256, to deter ASIC use. As of January 2014, there are now Scrypt ASIC chips being deployed by the Chinese for mining. So far, around 1000 Mhash of Gridseed ASIC chips have been brought online and used on the litecoin and middlecoin.com network.</p>
    <p>The Chinese chips have not been released on the greater market at large, but eventually they will, and the same problems that SHA256 currency faces will come to the Litecoin and other Scrypt currency networks next.</p>
